## Introduction
It is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal movement using activity monitoring devices such as a Fitbit, Nike Fuelband, or Jawbone Up. These type of devices are part of the ‚Äúquantified self‚Äù movement ‚Äì a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. But these data remain under-utilized both because the raw data are hard to obtain and there is a lack of statistical methods and software for processing and interpreting the data.

This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

The data for this assignment can be downloaded from the course web site:

* Dataset: [Activity monitoring data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip) 

The variables included in this dataset are:

steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as ùôΩùô∞) </br>
date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format </br>
interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken </br>
The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there are a total of 17,568 observations in this dataset. 

## Loading and preprocessing the data
Unzip data to obtain a csv file.

```{r}
# Import data
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
# libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
Sys.setlocale("LC_TIME", "English")
```
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

1. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day

```{r}
# create and print number of steps per day
StepsPerDay <- aggregate(activity$steps, list(activity$date), FUN=sum)
colnames(StepsPerDay) <- c("Date", "Steps")
StepsPerDay
```

2. If you do not understand the difference between a histogram and a barplot, research the difference between them. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day. 

```{r}
# draw the histogram
g <- ggplot(StepsPerDay, aes(Steps))
g+geom_histogram(boundary=0, binwidth=2500, col="darkgreen", fill="lightgreen")+ggtitle("Histogram of steps per day")+xlab("Steps")+ylab("Frequency")+theme(plot.title = element_text(face="bold", size=12))+scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,25000,2500))+scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,18,2))
```

3. Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
```{r}
# Mean
mean(StepsPerDay$Steps, na.rm=TRUE)
#Median
median(StepsPerDay$Steps, na.rm=TRUE)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

1. Make a time series plot (i.e. ùöùùö¢ùöôùöé = "ùöï") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

```{r}
# create table with steps per time
StepsPerTime <- aggregate(steps~interval,data=activity,FUN=mean,na.action=na.omit)
# variable time (more comprensible for the graph axis)
StepsPerTime$time <- StepsPerTime$interval/100
# draw the line plot
h <- ggplot(StepsPerTime, aes(time, steps))
h+geom_line(col="brown")+ggtitle("Average steps per time interval")+xlab("Time")+ylab("Steps")+theme(plot.title = element_text(face="bold", size=12))
```

2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

```{r}
# table for dplyr
ST <- tbl_df(StepsPerTime)
# find the column
ST %>% select(time, steps) %>% filter(steps==max(ST$steps))
```

## Imputing missing values

1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with ùôΩùô∞s)

```{r}
# table for dplyr
ACT <- tbl_df(activity)
# find the column
ACT %>% filter(is.na(steps)) %>% summarize(missing_values = n())
```

2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.

```{r}
# values without NA are imputed in a new column
activity$CompleteSteps <- ifelse(is.na(activity$steps), round(StepsPerTime$steps[match(activity$interval, StepsPerTime$interval)],0), activity$steps)
```

3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

```{r}
# new dataset activityFull
activityFull <- data.frame(steps=activity$CompleteSteps, interval=activity$interval, date=activity$date)
# see first 10 values of the new dataset
head(activityFull, n=10)
```

4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

```{r}
# prepare data
StepsPerDayFull <- aggregate(activityFull$steps, list(activityFull$date), FUN=sum)
colnames(StepsPerDayFull) <- c("Date", "Steps")
# draw the histogram
g <- ggplot(StepsPerDayFull, aes(Steps))
g+geom_histogram(boundary=0, binwidth=2500, col="darkblue", fill="lightblue")+ggtitle("Histogram of steps per day")+xlab("Steps")+ylab("Frequency")+theme(plot.title = element_text(face="bold", size=12))+scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,25000,2500))+scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,26,2))
# Mean
mean(StepsPerDayFull$Steps)
#Median
median(StepsPerDayFull$Steps)
```

Type of Estimate | Mean_Steps | Median_Steps
--- | --- | ---
First Part (with na) | 10765 | 10765
Second Part (fillin in na with median) | 9354.23 | 10395

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels ‚Äì ‚Äúweekday‚Äù and ‚Äúweekend‚Äù indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

```{r}
# Create variable with date in correct format
activityFull$RealDate <- as.Date(activityFull$date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
# create a variable with weekdays name
activityFull$weekday <- weekdays(activityFull$RealDate)
# create a new variable indicating weekday or weekend
activityFull$DayType <- ifelse(activityFull$weekday=='Saturday' | activityFull$weekday=='Sunday', 'weekend','weekday')
# see first 10 values
head(activityFull, n=10)
```

2. Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. ùöùùö¢ùöôùöé = "ùöï") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.

```{r}
# create table with steps per time across weekdaydays or weekend days
StepsPerTimeDT <- aggregate(steps~interval+DayType,data=activityFull,FUN=mean,na.action=na.omit)
# variable time (more comprensible for the graph axis)
StepsPerTimeDT$time <- StepsPerTime$interval/100
# draw the line plot
j <- ggplot(StepsPerTimeDT, aes(time, steps))
j+geom_line(col="darkred")+ggtitle("Average steps per time interval: weekdays vs. weekends")+xlab("Time")+ylab("Steps")+theme(plot.title = element_text(face="bold", size=12))+facet_grid(DayType ~ .)
```
