*__Getting and Cleaning Data : Project__*


**Introduction**


This repository contains code to process the UCI HAR Dataset.

The script run_analysis.R will merge the test and training data per the requirements for this project. It will then output the final "tidy" data set to a txt and/or csv file.

**Objective**

The files in this repository have been created according to the requirements set out for the Course Project.

The requirements were:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
The run_analysis.R file achieves all the requirements chronologically.

**The Raw Data**

The raw data used in this project and it's full description can be found here:(http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).
